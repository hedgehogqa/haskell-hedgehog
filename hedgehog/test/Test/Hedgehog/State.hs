-- | Test that 'commandAMkInput' works as expected when shrinking.
--
-- We create a state machine that always generates two actions. Initially, one
-- will have the number 5 as input and put it in state. The other will have
-- (True, 5) as input. It checks the number is less than 5. Since it's not, we
-- start shrinking.
--
-- We shrink the first action initially, through 4,3,2,1,0. Each of these
-- changes the input to the second action, even though we're not shrinking that,
-- because `commandMkInput` looks at the state. The second action passes with
-- each of these.
--
-- So then we shrink the second action, to (False, 5). That fails again, so we
-- go back to shrinking the first one. All of those shrinks pass again.
--
-- We log the list of inputs to the second action, and after running this state
-- machine (and ignoring its result) we check that this list is correct.
--
-- This depends on the order shrinks are performed in state machines. Hopefully
-- it won't be too fragile.
